          John Wick: Chapter 3 â€“ Parabellum (alternatively known as John Wick: Chapter 3 or simply John Wick 3) is a 2019 American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad, Shay Hatten, Chris Collins, and Marc Abrams, based on a story by Kolstad. It is the sequel to John Wick (2014) and John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), and is the third installment in the John Wick franchise. It stars Keanu Reeves as the eponymous character, alongside Halle Berry, Laurence Fishburne, Mark Dacascos, Asia Kate Dillon, Lance Reddick, Anjelica Huston, and Ian McShane. In the film, John Wick goes on the run from a legion of assassins after a bounty is placed for his murder.

          The third installment was announced in June 2017. Much of the returning cast and crew was confirmed in February 2018, with new members joining that May. Filming began that month and lasted through November, taking place in New York City, Montreal, and Morocco.
          
          Parabellum was theatrically released in the United States on May 17, 2019, by Lionsgate. It grossed $326 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the franchise in just 10 days, and received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences, visual style, and Reeves's performance.[5] A sequel, John Wick: Chapter 4, is set to be released on May 27, 2022.[6][7]</p>
